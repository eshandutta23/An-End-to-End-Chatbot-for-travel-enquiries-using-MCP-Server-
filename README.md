🚀 Project Overview

This project implements an AI-powered conversational travel assistant using the MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server concept.
The chatbot can answer travel-related queries such as destinations, budget-friendly countries, hotels, transport options, and general trip planning through a memory-enabled agentic architecture

Tech Stack:
Python 3.11 is used as the core programming language for building the application logic.

Groq LLM API is integrated via LangChain and LangChain-Groq to enable fast and accurate natural language processing.

Agentic AI architecture is implemented using the Model Context Protocol (MCP) with the mcp-use framework.

An MCP Client manages connections and context, while a memory-enabled MCP Agent handles reasoning and conversation flow.

A responsive user interface is developed using Streamlit for real-time user interaction.

uv is used for dependency and environment management along with a Python virtual environment (.venv).

python-dotenv is used to securely manage API keys and environment variables.

asyncio enables asynchronous execution for efficient request handling.

Git and GitHub are used for version control and project collaboration.
